# How to use

I used _yarn_ as package manager, but you could you _npm_ or any other that you prefer.


### Install dependencies
Firstly, you have to install the packages. The command is:

`yarn install`

For compile the contracts use:

`yarn hardhat compile`

### Setup .env files

You will need to setup a `.env` file for every network that you are going to use.
For example, `.env.polygon` and `.env.mumbai` would have the same variables, but with different values each. You can find the variables in `.env.example` file.

Each `.env.<network_name>` contains the variables names that the `.sample-env` file has.


### Tests

The contract is successfully tested with unit and an integration tests that executes `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions and assert that they emit their events successfully.

* **Unit tests**:

  `yarn hardhat test test/unit/supply-aave-unit.test.ts --network hardhat` for running all the unit test. The result is the following:
  Example of unit tests in local network (forking the polygon mainnet):

* **Integration tests**:

  `yarn hardhat test test/stagging/supply-aave-stag.test.ts --network <network_name>` for running the stagging test. The result is the following:
